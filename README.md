Weather app
Developed a dynamic weather application using React to provide real-time weather updates and forecasts. This
project demonstrated my ability to build interactive user interfaces and work with external APIs. Key Features:
Real-time weather data fetching using [weather API service, e.g., Open Weather Map]. User-friendly interface
with responsive design. Location-based weather updates.
